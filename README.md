IAT481 Exploring Artificial Intelligence: Its Use, Concepts, and Impact

Final Project

**Team members**:

- Sorren Jao
- Grigory Gogin


**System Requirements**:
- Python 3.12


**Quick Start**:
- To set up the application on a new machine, execute `prepare.bat` (Windows) and wait till it completes its job (can take up a long time due to a large number of dependencies needed to be installed).
- Execute `run.bat` (Windows) to launch the chatbot (the very first launch can take a while as it will download a 4GB variant of Llama-2 first).
