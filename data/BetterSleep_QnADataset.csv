Question,Answer
What sleep schedule is the most optimal?,"Research has shown it is better to set fixed times for going to bed and waking up and then adhere to them even on weekends. Our bodies heavily rely on circadian rhythms to regulate sleep patterns. If you go to bed at the same time every day it helps your body to acquire a steady habit of production of melatonin prior to your bedtime. Melatonin is a very important hormone that is related to circadian rhythms, day and night cycles. Increased level of melatonin is shown to help falling asleep faster and having a more quality sleep."
What are the phases of sleep?,"When you sleep, you cycle through two phases of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. The cycle starts over every 80 to 100 minutes. Usually there are four to six cycles per night. You may wake up briefly between cycles."
What is Non-REM sleep?,"Non-REM sleep has three stages, defined by measurements of brain activity taken in sleep studies.

    Stage 1. This stage is the transition between wakefulness and sleep.
    Stage 2. When you reach stage 2, you are asleep.
    Stage 3. This stage is called deep sleep or slow-wave sleep, after a particular pattern that appears in measurements of brain activity. You usually spend more time in this stage early in the night."
What is REM sleep?,"During REM sleep, your eyes twitch and your brain is active. Brain activity measured during REM sleep is similar to your brainâ€™s activity during waking hours. Dreaming usually happens during REM sleep. Your muscles normally become limp to prevent you from acting out your dreams. You usually have more REM sleep later in the night, but you do not have as much REM sleep in colder temperatures. This is because, during REM sleep, your body does not regulate its temperature properly."
How do we know there are phases of sleep?,"Sleep studies use sensors to record eye movements and brain activity, which are used to classify sleep phases and stages."
Why is sleep important?,"Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout your life. The way you feel while you are awake depends in part on what happens while you are sleeping. During sleep, your body is working to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health.In children and teens, sleep also helps support growth and development. Getting inadequate sleep over time can raise your risk for chronic (long-term) health problems. It can also affect how well you think, react, work, learn, and get along with others. Learn how sleep affects your heart and circulatory system, metabolism , respiratory system, and immune system and how much sleep is enough."
