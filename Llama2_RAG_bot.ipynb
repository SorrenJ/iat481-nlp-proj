    "In this notebook, we will pick up where we have left in the [preparation notebook](https://github.com/shaaagri/iat481-nlp-proj/blob/main/LLama2_vanilla_bot.ipynb) and will add a vector store with a retriever to the pipeline. This should be enough to lay the framework to realize our intention - a chatbot powered by RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), which is, in essence, a special case of automated prompt engineering. Just a reminder, the specialized knowledge we plan to inject into the chatbot is concerned with sleep hygiene and related science-backed tips.\n",

The latter is going to neatly store these representations, providing access to them as needed.

    "### Choosing the Text Embedding Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long time, there was little choice for a specific model that produces the embeddings beside OpenAI's `ada-002`, which is provided through API requiring a small fee to use. However, by April 2024 (the time of writing this notebook) the range has considerably increased, and now there are not only players in the market (e.g. [Cohere](https://cohere.com/embeddings), [Jina](https://jina.ai/embeddings/) - both offer a free tier) but also open-source text embeddings model can be found, such as `SentenceTransformers` available at Hugging Face ([link](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers)). \n",
    "\n",
    "As students we are delighted to be able to use another model free of charge; our only question is whether it performs comparably to ada-002. The good news is that our brief research has told us we should be fine with the open-source Sentence Transformers (which come as a [family of models](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html]) each trading off performance for quality in various ways) - here are the resources we are referring to: [(1)](https://iamnotarobot.substack.com/p/should-you-use-openais-embeddings), [(2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11okrni/discussion_compare_openai_and_sentencetransformer/), [(3)](https://supabase.com/blog/fewer-dimensions-are-better-pgvector), ([4](https://weaviate.io/blog/how-to-choose-a-sentence-transformer-from-hugging-face])).\n",
    "\n",
    "The consensus seems to be that it's not necessary to use ada-002 at all as the open-source models match it and sometimes even exceed it in performance. One particular text embedding model that seems to have an ideal balance between size, speed, and accuracy is `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. It also has an \"older brother\", a slightly larger model `all-MiniLM-L12-v2`, and according to [this table](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html), it's only marginally better than all-MiniLM-L6-v2, while being significantly slower. All in all, we think the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model is an excellent start, given our use case is mostly concerned with general purpose English words. It is also supported by LangChain out of the box. "

    "As for the vector database that is going to store the embeddings, the decision is considerably easier. It comes down to two well-known alternatives: `Pinecone` (managed) and `ChromaDB` (self-hosted). To remind the reader, our guiding design principle is to get away with open-source and/or free-tier components for 100% of the pipeline, hence ChromeDB is the obvious choice. To consult with some literature we checked, for instance, [this article](https://medium.com/@sakhamurijaikar/which-vector-database-is-right-for-your-generative-ai-application-pinecone-vs-chromadb-1d849dd5e9df), and it confirmed our assumptions that ChromaDB should be more than enough for what is just a student prototype."

    "Great, clearly our CSV data has been ingested into the vector DB successfully, and querying it behaves as expected. Our dataset is small, therefore a simple similarity search should suffice. It must be noted, however, that had we needed to pick top `k` chunks with even more precision and relevance (e.g. from a very large database with hundreds of thousands of records), this technique could be made more advanced by combining it with a **Reranker** - basically, a separate DNN model that reorders the results taking a deeper look into the nuances of semantics (an example description of that can be found [here](https://superlinked.com/vectorhub/articles/optimizing-rag-with-hybrid-search-reranking)).\n",

    "Simply awesome! The response we have got is sensible, concise and factually correct, and its generation did not take a lot of time (we get about ~10 tokens per second, which is just fine for streaming). We also can see in the debugging information that the relevant Q&A pair is being used as part of the hidden augmented prompt. Everything is in its right place and now we only need to package this code into a Python project and set it up so that it can be served to users through a simple web UI (any open-source chatbot UI would suffice, for example, [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) mentioned previously)."
